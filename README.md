# Data Structures and Algorithm Design

## Assignment 2

### Problem Statement:
    There are N different models of mobiles manufactured at a mobile manufacturing unit. Each mobile must go through 2 major phases: ‘parts manufacturing’ and ‘assembling’. Obviously, ‘parts manufacturing’ must happen before “assembling’. The time for ‘parts manufacturing’ and ‘assembling’ (pmi and ai for ith mobile) for every mobile may be different. If we have only 1 unit for ‘parts manufacturing’ and 1 unit for ‘assembling’, how should we produce n mobiles in a suitable order such that the total production time is minimized?

### Requirements:
 1. Write a Greedy Algorithm to select the mobile ‘parts manufacturing’ and ‘assembling’ in such a way that total production time is minimized.
 2. Analyse the time complexity of your algorithm.
 3. Implement the above problem statement using Python.


### Expectation
 1. Word document designPS1_<group id>.docx detailing your algorithm design and time complexity of the algorithm.
 2. Zipped AS2_PS1_MM_[Group id].py package folder containing all the modules classes and functions for the employee node, binary      tree and the main body of the program.
 3. inputPS1.txt file used for testing
 4. outputPS1.txt file generated while testing
  
### How to run?
 1. Goto the application directory
 2. Run $ python .\mobile_manufacturing.py
 3. The output is printed in the /output/OutputPS1.txt file.
